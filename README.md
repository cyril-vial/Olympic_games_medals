# Content
This project follows my participation in a data science bootcamp last summer.
It aims to cover fundamental yet essential processes, from data cleaning to model evaluation.
The project uses the dataset "athlete_event.csv", which records athletes' performances at the Summer and Winter Olympic Games since their inception, including numerous continuous and categorical variables.
The goal of this project is to accurately predict whether an athlete will win a medal or not.
The organization of the code may be somewhat clumsy at times—apologies for that.

Enjoy the read.

# Dataset
The `data/` folder contains :
- `athlete_event.csv` → raw data of athletes at the OG
- `dataset_train_clean/` → Cleaned data
- `noc_regions/` → Dictionary of regions to identify countries
- `global_polygons.geojson/` → Shapes of countries


NB: do not forget to adapt the files' path to your local environnement.


# Results

You can find various graphs describing the results of the project in the `results/` folder.
